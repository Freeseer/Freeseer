TODO: add translation settings

Misc notes on translation:
  - the current translation scheme could use some work; this could be a possible future fosslc/gsoc project
  - should be converted to whatever the standard for qt is, and get & listen to the system language
  
  - or we could continue on our custom organization, and set it up to use mixins.
  - if I do have time or need to add transation settings, I'll be making a mixin
    - making the mixin will simply involve moving the translation logic from talkeditor to a new class, 
       and inheriting that class in talkeditorApp. then inherit that class in videouploaderApp 
  
  scratch that, i figured it out.
  http://www.pyside.org/docs/pyside/PySide/QtCore/QCoreApplication.html#PySide.QtCore.PySide.QtCore.QCoreApplication.installTranslator
  
  All we need to do for dynamic translation is 
   - call QtCore.QCoreApplication.installTranslator() at the beginning
   - call QTranslator.load() when we want to change the tranlsation
   - decorate your gui classes with @videouploader.retranslateOnLanguageChange
     - they must have a retranslate function
    
time remaining: 9 to 26 hours
mandatory time: less than 20 hours (hopefully)
