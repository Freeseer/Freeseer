BOO! HISS!\nIn this session you'll learn how to convert your own designs into your own awesome Drupal themes in five easy steps.\nWe'll cover the basics of how to:\n    * Optimize your design files to make theming easier.\n* Evaluate common base themes and know when to choose between several popular base themes (e.g. 960.gs, Zen).\n* Create a new Drupal theme by extending a base theme.\n* Develop common template files (tpl.php) necessary to theme pages and nodes using a text editor.\n* Share your designs with others (licensing, uploading to drupal.org and selling your themes).\nWhether you want to build and sell your own designs, or you're a newly hired designer at a Drupal Web development shop, this session will give you the confidence to transform your imagination into a working Web site.\nPrerequisite: This is for Intermediate Drupal Users. For beginners or those evaluating Drupal for the first time, we highly recommend attending the Drupal KickStart Program on Monday, May 3rd.",

Further though it will look at why ARM matters for Linux, why Linaro is vital to its success, and what role you may be able to play in that.",

The user is marginalized in open source development discussions.  The value of the user is not well understood, and difficult to quantify.\nThis talk examines the role of the user in open source ecosystems and takes a closer look at how the user contributes to the health and growth of the ecosystem.  It suggests that the user is in fact an integral component of open source ecosystems, and that its contribution, while passive, is key to long term success.\nIn the presentation, the evolving role of the user is examined, and an attempt is made to describe the means of quantifying the value of user participation to the ecosystem.  The target audience of this presentation is open source community organizers, ecosystem participants, and open source proponents in general, especially those with entrepreneurial inclinations.",

            "Abstract" : "400 Character Summary:\nHundreds of thousands of TikiWiki installations are used for a myriad of online collaboration and social applications, including the high-profile Firefox Support site. Not just developers, but end-users and business analysts can enhance or combine modular application configurations defined in easy-to-learn YAML, leading to new and innovative applications for the platform that are easily deployed.\nAbstract:\nWith over 1,000 features and configuration options, the open source TikiWiki platform has been used for applications ranging from web content management, online collaboration, file sharing, documentation, intranet/extranet, project/event management, knowledge sharing/management, wiki, blogging, social media, and online community. Consistently ranked in the top 100 applications on Sourceforge, TikiWiki is downloaded over 7,000 times a month and there are hundreds of thousands of installations worldwide, including the Firefox Support site that is directly linked from in-browser help.\nWith so many possibilities for different uses, the TikiWiki Community was looking for a way to rapidly deploy applications on the platform, avoiding tedious configuration of the many individual features. These deployment configurations are defined in YAML, a popular machine-parsable data serialization format that is designed for human readability. Called Tiki Profiles, these configurations are extremely modular, and can be combined to form larger applications. For example, it is possible to combine the configurations for a Time Sheet, a Task List and a Consultant List, to create a basic consultant time-management system. When executed, the Tiki Profiles engine will automatically configure necessary features, create content pages, data structures, user groups, permissions, and input forms that make up the application.\nThese modular configurations in easy-to-learn YAML are shared just like open source code, but within a wiki, profiles.tikiwiki.org. Not just developers, but end-users and business analysts can enhance or combine these configurations, leading to new and innovative applications for the platform. For example, the basic consultant time-management system as mentioned above can easily be augmented with a Budget Tracking application to enhance billing management. Repeated application configuration becomes easy, and application variants can be managed more effectively as incremental add-ons to the same base Tiki Profile.",

(Hint: It matters who owns the thing that is locked, and who holds the keys)\nWe will go through a little history discussing the origins of this policy, as well as a few treaties, trade agreements, and laws in other countries which contain this policy.\nIn the discussion it is expected we will encourage participants to become politically involved in helping clarify this issue for politicians and other policy makers, so we can avoid (or amend) very bad laws.",
