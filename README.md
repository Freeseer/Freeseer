The Freeseer project is a powerful software suite for capturing or streaming video. 

It enables you to capture great presentations, demos, training material, and other videos.
It handles desktop screen-casting with ease.

It is one of a few such tools that can also record [VGA][vga-wiki] output or video
from external sources such as [FireWire][firewire-wiki], [USB][usb-wiki], [S-Video][svideo-wiki], or [RCA][rca-wiki].

It is particularly good at handling very large conferences with hundreds 
of talks and speakers using varied hardware and operating systems.

Freeseer itself can run on commodity hardware such as a laptop or desktop.
It is supported on Windows, and Linux. MacOS will be supported very soon.

Freeseer is written in Python. It uses Qt4 for its GUI and Gstreamer for video/audio processing.

Freeseer supports free (royalty free) audio and video codecs.

    NOTES:
    	- Windows 32-bit packages are recommended when installing the above packages.
    	  This is because pygtk-all-in-one package at the time of this writing does
    	  not have a 64bit installer.
    	- The above software versions are known to work well. Python does need to be version 2.7.*

          On windows, add the following paths to your PATH variable:
          C:\Python26;C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\PyQt4\bin

following commands:
        "./freeseer-record"         This is the Freeseer mainapp
        "./freeseer-config"         This is the Configuration tool
        "./freeseer-talkeditor"     This is the Talk List editor

If you would like to create packages, read PACKAGE.txt for instructions.

If you wish to capture vga input using epiphan's vga2usb device:
    first, copy the vga2usb.ko driver to /lib/modules/<kernel version>
    for the kernel you're running. Epiphan provides a list of pre-compiled
    drivers at http://epiphan.com

    Then, configure the driver:
    "sudo cp vga2usb.conf /etc/modprobe.d/; depmod -a"
